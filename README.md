# Pneumonia Detection System

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that affects millions globally, making early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment.
This project seeks to explore a novel graph-based approach to pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images, aiming to enhance both the accuracy and explainability of the diagnosis process.
K-Nearest Neighbour Graphs are going to be used for content-based image retrieval, classification, and similarity measures.

# Solution

To enhance the accuracy and interpretability of pneumonia detection, we propose utilizing K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) Graphs for content-based image retrieval, classification, and similarity analysis. 
In this approach, each chest X-ray image is represented as a node within a graph, and edges are formed between images based on visual or feature-space similarity. 
This structure enables the system to retrieve and compare images with similar patterns, facilitating more reliable classification by referencing known cases. 
By leveraging neighbourhood information, the K-NN graph aids in identifying subtle pathological features and improving diagnostic consistency. This method also supports better explainability, as clinicians can visually inspect similar cases used in the decision-making process.
